- 👋 Hi, I’m @calluthersg
- 👀 I’m interested in using GitHub to host a project and get back into programming from many, many moons ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create an App that will work with HubSpot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HubSpot development, although I am a beginner all over again. :-)
- 📫 How to reach me ... anyway you prefer.
